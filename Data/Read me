The "Dataset_space_data" file contains location information, including latitude and longitude, for each dataset. 
The spatio-temporal daily data for the three variables used in the analysis (PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, CO, Population density, Nighttime light, LUM, and Air temperature ) are stored separately as "Dataset__data". 
All datasets consist of daily observations with missing values appropriately handled.
