# STCV
## The space_data file contains location information, including latitude and longitude, for each dataset. The spatio-temporal daily data for the three variables used in the analysis (PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and CO) are stored separately as Dataset_<variable>_data. All datasets consist of daily observations with missing values appropriately handled.
